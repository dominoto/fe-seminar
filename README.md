This was the final project for (Front-end Developer course)[https://www.algebra.hr/cjelozivotno-obrazovanje/programi/front-end-developer/] at (Algebra University College)[https://www.algebra.hr/].

The task is to write a web chat application. The technologies for creating the application are arbitrary, it is only important that with the chosen technologies it is possible to realize all the conditions of the functional specification.

Functional specification: It is necessary to create a functional user interface for chat participants and upload the created code to GitHub.

The mentioned chat application should:
- be able to create new text messages
- press enter or click on the "send" message button (display it on the screen next to the author's name)
- for each participant in the chat, select a random color and/or name that identifies them
- connect to the Scaledrone service and successfully simulate the conversation of all active users
- be available through a public GitHub account

Used technologies: HTML, CSS, React, Scaledrone API, gh-pages.
